# Bug Bounties

Semux is happy to reward finding bugs with a SEM bounty.  We value community contributions.

* Submit issue tickets at https://github.com/semuxproject/semux/issues
* Please do not leave your semux address in the issue ticket. Instead, you're recommended to put your address on your profile bio.
* Only tickets labelled as `bug` are eligible for bug bounty. The reward is 100 ~ 100,000 SEM based on its severity and impact.
* We process bug bounty monthly. You can also contact dev@semux.org, if you urgently need it.
* Thanks!
